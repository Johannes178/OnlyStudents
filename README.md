## OnlyStudents

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# What kind of service is it?

An information application for students to which various Metropolia organizations can publish newsletters and media. The other part of the service focuses more on communication between students on a discussion basis.

# Who is it for?

For Metropolia students who are eager for new information about events and current affairs, as well as for communication with each other and between organizations.

# What need does it meet? What problem does it solve?

Combines all media in one place, so you don't have to search for information from many different services.

# How does it work? How is the problem solved?

Organizations create an account for the service, and the user can choose from the organizations they like and follow their newsletters, as well as start current discussions on school / leisure topics.
